        <h1>The Peloponnesian war</h1>

    <div class="text">
        <h2>Long term causes</h2>
        <p>1. Rivalry between Athens and Sparta for dominance in Greece</p>
        <p>2. Different political systems: Athens was a democracy, Sparta an oligarchy</p>
        <p>3. Athens' expansionist policy and formation of the Delian League</p>
        <p>4. Fear and insecurity among smaller Greek city-states (forced them to pick a side)</p>
        <h2>Short term causes</h2>
        <p>1. Megarian Decree: Athens banned trade with Megara, a Spartan ally, causing economic hardship</p>
        <p>2. Corinthian support: Corinth, a Spartan ally, sought support against Athens for intervening in a dispute with Corcyra</p>
        <p>3. Battle of Potidaea: Athens intervened in a dispute between Potidaea, a Corinthian colony, and Athens, causing Corinth to declare war</p>
        <p>4. Spartans' fear of Athens' growing power and influence</p>

    <div class="text">
        <h2>Consequences</h2>
        <p>1. Loss of life and devastation: The war lasted for nearly 30 years, and many Greek city-states suffered significant losses in terms of population, resources, and infrastructure.</p>
        <p>2. Weakened city-states: Both Athens and Sparta were left weakened and vulnerable, allowing other city-states, such as Thebes and Corinth, to rise to power.</p>
        <p>3. End of Athenian empire: Athens, which had been the dominant power in Greece, was defeated and lost its empire, including control of its overseas territories and the Delian League.</p>
        <p>4. Rise of Sparta: Sparta emerged as the dominant power in Greece, but its victory was short-lived, as it was later defeated by Thebes.</p>
        <p>5. Impact on Greek culture: The war had a significant impact on Greek culture, as many people were disillusioned by the destruction and loss of life. This led to a shift away from the ideal of the "noble warrior" and towards a more introspective and philosophical worldview.</p>
        <p>6. Impact on Western civilization: The Peloponnesian War had a lasting impact on Western civilization, as it helped to shape many of the political and philosophical ideas that would come to define Western culture. The war was studied by philosophers such as Thucydides and Plato, and its lessons were incorporated into their ideas about justice, democracy, and the nature of human conflict.</p>
